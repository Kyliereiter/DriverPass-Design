# CS 255: System Analysis and Design – Reflection

This repository contains my work for Projects One and Two of CS 255, where I developed both a **Business Requirements Document (BRD)** and a **System Design Document (SDD)** for the DriverPass project.

## Project Overview
The DriverPass project was based on a real-world client scenario. DriverPass needed a modern, web-based system to support students preparing for their driving exams. The system was designed to provide online practice tests, scheduling for driving lessons, and administrative tools for instructors and staff. The ultimate goal was to replace inefficient, paper-based processes with a digital solution that improved accessibility, accuracy, and user experience.

**The system was designed to provide:**
- Online practice tests  
- Scheduling for driving lessons  
- Administrative tools for instructors and staff

## Strengths in My Work
One of my strongest contributions was translating high-level client needs into detailed technical models and diagrams. By creating UML use case and sequence diagrams, I clearly represented how different users (students, instructors, administrators) interact with the system. This visual modeling helped ensure the final design captured all core functions and user flows.

## Areas for Improvement
If I could revise one part of my work, it would be the initial Business Requirements Document. While it effectively captured system goals, I would expand it by developing more detailed user personas. Accounting for varying levels of technical skill among students or instructors could lead to an even more intuitive interface design from the start.

## Interpreting User Needs (and Why It Matters)
I interpreted user needs by analyzing the scenario’s pain points—manual scheduling, limited visibility into availability, and paper-based records. I mapped these needs to use cases such as **“Schedule a Lesson,” “View Availability,”** and **“Take Practice Tests,”** then validated them across the different actors (student, instructor, admin). Considering user needs is critical: a system that doesn’t solve real user problems in an accessible way will fail regardless of its technical quality.

## Design Approach and Future Techniques
I take a “broad-to-narrow” approach similar to Agile:
1. Capture high-level goals and constraints.
2. Break them into user stories and use cases.
3. Model flows with activity/sequence diagrams.
4. Iterate based on feedback.

**Going forward, I would:**
- Prototype earlier (wireframes/clickable mockups) to get stakeholder feedback before build.
- Keep a tighter loop between personas, journeys, and UI sketches to ensure usability remains front-and-center.
