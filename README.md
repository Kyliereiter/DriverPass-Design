# CS 255: System Analysis and Design â€“ Reflection

This repository contains my work for Projects One and Two of CS 255, where I developed both a **Business Requirements Document (BRD)** and a **System Design Document (SDD)** for the DriverPass project.

## Project Overview
The DriverPass project was based on a real-world client scenario. DriverPass needed a modern, web-based system to support students preparing for their driving exams. The system was designed to provide online practice tests, scheduling for driving lessons, and administrative tools for instructors and staff. The ultimate goal was to replace inefficient, paper-based processes with a digital solution that improved accessibility, accuracy, and user experience.

## Strengths in My Work
One of my strongest contributions was translating high-level client needs into detailed technical models and diagrams. By creating UML use case and sequence diagrams, I was able to clearly represent how different users (students, instructors, administrators) would interact with the system. This visual modeling ensured that the final design captured all core functions and user flows.

## Areas for Improvement
If I could revise one part of my work, it would be the initial Business Requirements Document. While it effectively captured system goals, I would expand it by developing more detailed user personas. For example, accounting for varying levels of technical skill among students or instructors could have led to an even more user-friendly interface design from the start.
